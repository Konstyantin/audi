The SUV with the four rings combines the sportiness of an Audi sedan with a multifaceted character and a highly flexible interior. Whether in its connectivity, efficiency or driver assistance systems &ndash; the new Audi Q5 once again sets standards in its segment.</strong></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The first Audi Q5 was for many years the world&rsquo;s best-selling SUV in its class. It was no easy task to design its successor, but that is precisely why it is so very exciting,&rdquo; says Rupert Stadler, Chairman of the Board of Management at AUDI AG. &ldquo;With the new Q5 we are setting the bar a notch higher. Among the great innovations are the quattro drive system with ultra technology, highly efficient engines, the air suspension with damper control and a comprehensive line-up of infotainment and assistance systems.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The new SUV from Audi takes a sporty and taut stance on the street. A sculpturally flared Singleframe grille with a solid frame dominates its aerodynamically flat front end. It is available with headlights that are either in LED or high-resolution Matrix LED technology with dynamic turn lights.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Typically Audi: Reference to the quattro drive<br /></strong>A distinctively curved and strongly undercut shoulder line gives structure to the side view. The strongly emphasized wheel arches are a reference to the quattro permanent all-wheel drive system, and the low greenhouse tapers back down early. Just as at the front, horizontal lines at the rear convey an image of width and presence. The tail lights are also available with optional dynamic turn signals. The tailgate wraps around the C-pillars &ndash; a typical feature of the Q models from Audi. A diffuser insert integrates the exhaust tailpipes.</p>\r\n<p>Audi is offering the new Q5 in 14 different exterior colors. Five newly configured equipment lines are available &ndash; sport and design, the S line sport package, design selection and the S line exterior package. They influence the overall appearance. In the design line, contrasting gray add-on parts emphasize the rugged character of the new SUV, while the sport equipment line of the Audi Q5 has parts fully painted in the exterior color.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Weight saved: up to 90 kg <em>(198.4 lb)</em> lighter than the previous model<br /></strong>4.66&nbsp;meters <em>(15.3 ft)</em> long, 1.89 meters <em>(6.2 ft)</em> wide and 1.66 meters <em>(5.4 ft)</em> tall with a 2.82&nbsp;meter <em>(9.3 ft)</em> wheelbase &ndash; compared to the previous model, the new Q5 has grown in nearly all of its dimensions. Consequently, the unladen weight was reduced &ndash; depending on the engine &ndash; by up to 90 kg <em>(198.4 lb)</em>. Steels with maximum tensile strength and aluminum form an intelligent material mix in the body.</p>\r\n<p>The new Q5 also stands at the top of its class in its aerodynamics. The four-cylinder versions attain a c<sub>d</sub> figure of 0.30 with the aerodynamically optimized roof. Wind noises are exceptionally low, and vibration comfort is high &ndash; the new SUV from Audi indulges the driver and passengers with the best interior acoustics in its class.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spacious and wide: the interior<br /></strong>The interior offers a lot of space for five persons, and it surpasses the previous model and its competitors in key dimensions. Its horizontally oriented lines underscore the impression of width and comfort, and a three-dimensional trim strip runs across the entire width of the instrument panel. The new equipment lines concept offers customers a broad selection of colors and materials.</p>\r\n<p>The new, high-efficiency air conditioner is available in two versions. A three-spoke multifunction steering wheel is standard; additional functions such as steering wheel heating are optional. Seat features range all the way to a pneumatic massage function. When it is dark, the optional ambient lighting (standard with design selection) creates an attractive atmosphere in 30 different colors. The workmanship quality in the new Q5 is uncompromising.</p>\r\n<p>The rear seat back of the new Audi Q5 is split into three segments. Longitudinal and seat back angle adjustment are optional. Depending on the rear seat position, the basic volume of the luggage compartment ranges from 550 to 610 liters <em>(19.4 to 21.5 cu ft)</em>, 10 liters <em>(0.4 cu ft)</em> more than in the previous model. When the rear bench is folded down, this volume grows to 1,550 liters <em>(54.7 cu ft)</em>. Cargo loading is simplified by intelligent solutions like a standard, variably folding mat, optional sensor control of the power tailgate and manual lowering of the body via the optional air suspension.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Simply coherent: controls and displays<br /></strong>Operation of the new Audi SUV is intuitive and is marked by three great new features. The optional Audi virtual cockpit presents brilliant graphics on its high-resolution 12.3-inch screen. The driver can choose from two views &ndash;&nbsp;a classic view with large round instruments and a mode in which the navigation map or lists dominate. The also optional head-up display projects key information onto the windshield.</p>\r\n<p>The MMI terminal in the center console acts as the main control element. In the top infotainment system, the MMI navigation plus with MMI touch and an 8.3-inch display, a touchpad is integrated into the rotary pushbutton. It recognizes handwritten entries as well as gestures familiar from consumer electronics such as zooming gestures. If the new Q5 has an automatic transmission, it also has the larger MMI all-in-touch including haptic feedback.</p>\r\n<p>The MMI operating logic is based on the flat hierarchies used in today&rsquo;s smartphones, and it offers such features as intelligent free-text search. The new natural-language voice control function also recognizes inputs from everyday speech. Serving as an additional third operating level in the new&nbsp;Audi Q5 is the multifunction steering wheel plus. Audi can deliver a newly developed head-up display as an option. It projects relevant information onto the windshield &ndash; including from driver assistance systems &ndash; as symbols and numbers that can be perceived quickly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Audi navigation: &ldquo;Personal route assist&rdquo;<br /></strong>The new Audi Q5, like the Q7 and the A4, has a self-learning &ldquo;personal route assist&rdquo; function. After activating this function, the navigation system learns the routes and destinations that the customer regularly selects, and it associates this information to the parked position and time of day.</p>\r\n<p>For as long as it is active, the system therefore learns from the customer&rsquo;s behavior and uses this information to suggest optimized route planning for the next trip &ndash; even while navigation is inactive. The navigation system incorporates the three most likely destinations into the calculation, taking into consideration both the arrival time and current traffic levels. For instance, the system can suggest that the customer activate navigation to find out about potential alternative routes. The driver decides whether or not to activate the function. He also has the option of deleting saved destinations. If the function is deactivated, the system does not store the destinations and does not consider deleted destinations or the routes driven.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Online via LTE: MMI navigation plus<br /></strong>MMI navigation plus utilizes the Audi connect module to integrate a LTE module and a Wi-Fi hotspot &ndash; this lets passengers go online with up to&nbsp;eight mobile devices. Audi connect enables convenient roaming in Europe for many Audi connect services with its permanently installed SIM card &ndash; the&nbsp;Audi connect SIM with a flat data rate. If they wish, users can also book data packages for the Wi-Fi hotspot at attractive prices, which also include EU roaming.</p>\r\n<p>The free Audi MMI connect app produces a close interconnection between the car and smartphone or a smartwatch and offers other services. They include remote checking of important vehicle states, online media streaming and transmission of a calendar from a smartphone to the MMI.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/img/article/The new Audi Q5/2436x1552_all_new_q5_offroad.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>High-end option: the infotainment modules<br /></strong>The Audi phone box connects smartphones to the vehicle&rsquo;s antenna for optimal reception quality; it also charges smartphones inductively according to the Qi standard. The Bang&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Olufsen Sound&nbsp;System with innovative 3D sound introduces the spatial dimension of height. The Audi&nbsp;tablet, which is also new, serves as a flexible Rear&nbsp;Seat&nbsp;Entertainment device. The Audi smartphone interface also brings Apple CarPlay and Android Auto into the new Q5.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Driver assistance and safety systems<br /></strong>In its driver assistance systems, the new Audi Q5 also tops its segment with a broad range of high-tech options. In their intelligent interplay, the systems represent a next step towards piloted driving. They are bundled into three packages &ndash; Tour, City and Parking.</p>\r\n<p>The predictive efficiency assistant helps the driver save fuel by specific information on the car&rsquo;s surroundings. Adaptive cruise control (ACC) including traffic jam assist can handle some of the steering work in slow-moving traffic. Audi active lane assist makes it easier to stay in lane. Distance warning alerts the driver when the distance to a vehicle drops below a safe distance.</p>\r\n<p>Cross traffic assist rear, the exit warning system, collision avoidance assist and turn assist are other new features that perform excellently in pursuit of safety. The same applies to the pre sense systems &ndash; Audi pre sense city is a standard feature which warns of pedestrians and vehicles and may initiate automatic emergency braking within system limits. Park assist, the camera-based recognition of traffic signs and hill descent assist round out the features.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Powerful quintet: TDI and TFSI engines<br /></strong>The new Audi Q5 is launching in Europe with five powerful and efficient engines: four TDI engines* and one TFSI*. They have added up to 20 kW (27 hp) of power, with fuel consumption however being significantly reduced. Particularly the 2.0 TDI engines in the new Q5, with outputs of 110&nbsp;kW&nbsp;(150 hp), 120 kW (163 hp) and 140 kW (190 hp), are highly efficient.</p>\r\n<p>The two top engines combine ample power with efficiency. The further developed 2.0 TFSI* has an output of 185 kW (252 hp), yet it only consumes 6.8 liters of gasoline per 100 km <em>(34.6 US mpg)</em>, which equates to 154 grams CO<sub>2</sub> per km <em>(247.8 g/mi)</em>. The also intensively revised 3.0 TDI* increases output to 210 kW (286 hp) with 620 Nm <em>(457.3 lb ft)</em> of torque.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','2016-11-22 06:40:01','news'),(2,'Perfect weekend Audi Sport TT Cup','<p><img src=\"/img/article/Perfect weekend Audi Sport TT Cup/general.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\r\n<p>Dennis Marschall made his mark on the Hungarian premiere of the Audi Sport TT Cup. At the Hungaroring, the German celebrated two lights-to-flag victories and reduced his deficit to overall leader Joonas Lappalainen from Finland to nine points. Now, the showdown will take place in the season&rsquo;s finale at Hockenheim. In the guest entrants&rsquo; classification, two stars from the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), Chaz Davies and Xavi For&eacute;s, were on the grid.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page-row has-no-item-box\">\r\n<div id=\"item-15c230a1-2d63-4419-a8d7-b504ed66315e\" class=\"page-item--text\">\r\n<div class=\"style-links-for-body-text\">\r\n<p>Marshall had demonstrated his ambitions for the weekend as early as in qualifying, clinching the top spot on the grid for both races. From pole position, the native of Karlsruhe did not give his rivals the slightest chance and scored an uncontested victory twice. &ldquo;That was an impressive performance,&rdquo; praised Project Leader Philipp Mondelaers. &ldquo;But our other young talents delivered fantastic motorsport once more as well. The premiere in Hungary was a resounding success.&rdquo; Trailing Marschall, overall leader Joonas Lappalainen clinched a clear second place. Sheldon van der Linde from South Africa completed the top three.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/img/article/Perfect weekend Audi Sport TT Cup/A1610316_large.jpg\" width=\"50%\" /></p>\r\n<p>In the guest entrants&rsquo; classification, the grid at the Hungaroring again included two high-caliber entrants, WorldSBK stars Chaz Davies and Xavi For&eacute;s. The Spaniard For&eacute;s decided the duel of the motorcycle campaigners in his favor, celebrating a second and a third place. For Davies, both races ended early following collisions he was not at fault in. In spite of this, the Welshman had huge fun switching from two to four wheels and is leaving Budapest with plenty of positive memories. The Dutchman Milan Dontje dominated the action in the guest entrants&rsquo; classification. The seasoned campaigner won both races and fought a number of spectacular duels with the permanent entrants.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','2016-11-22 06:40:04','sport'),(3,'Leader of the pack: the new Audi SQ7 TDI','<p><img src=\"/img/article/Leader of the pack: the new Audi SQ7 TDI/general.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>Say goodbye to turbo lag. With its electric powered compressor, the Audi SQ7 TDI* storms ahead with full power the moment the accelerator is depressed. It corners as nimbly as a sports sedan, but at 5.07 meters <em>(16.6 ft) </em>in length offers room for up to seven persons. When it comes to assistance systems, the SUV is the world champion in its segment.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>A push of the red-rimmed start button and the V8 diesel comes to life</strong> with a deep rumble that promises real power: 435 hp and 900 Newton meters <em>(663.8 lb-ft)</em> from 1,000 rpm. The SQ7 TDI delivers full power right away thanks to a world&rsquo;s first: the electric powered compressor that supports the two turbochargers at low engine speeds. Turbo lag &ndash; that&rsquo;s history. The energy is provided by the 48 volt electrical subsystem, a new technology in this segment. The 100 km/h <em>(62.1 mph)</em> mark falls in less than five seconds, and acceleration continues up to 250 km/h <em>(155.3 mph)</em>. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the SUV is particularly thirsty, however. It consumes on average just 7.2 liters per 100 kilometers <em>(32.7 US mpg)</em>.</p>\r\n<p>With the innovative, electromechanical active roll stabilization, <strong>cornering <br /> is just as much fun as in a sports sedan</strong>. The SQ7 TDI can be driven even faster through sharp corners and remains stable at the limit thanks to the sport differential. All-wheel steering allows the 5.07 meter <em>16.6 ft)</em> long SUV to be easily maneuvered into parking spaces or around corners. Standard all-wheel drive is at the ready for both snowy mountain passes and off-road adventures. No matter how rough the road may be, the air suspension with a continuously variable, electronically controlled damper system ensures that the passengers don&rsquo;t notice a thing.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>choice of 24 assistance systems</strong> is unmatched in the segment. In slow-moving traffic on well-paved roads, the traffic jam assist can take over the steering at speeds up to 65 km/h <em>(40.4 mph)</em> &ndash; a pre-stage of piloted driving. On top of that, the SQ7 TDI helps to stay in the lane, brakes in hazardous situations, monitors oncoming traffic when turning left and detects pedestrians and animals in the dark.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The infotainment line up is also top-notch</strong>. Audi equips the SQ7 TDI with a sophisticated system with a large touchpad. The driver can control it using a free text search function and natural voice commands. To call a contact, the driver can just say &ldquo;I want to call Peter Miller.&rdquo; The system also has a quick answer for questions like &ldquo;Where is the closest gas station?&rdquo; That is both convenient and safe. An 8.3-inch monitor or the all-digital Audi virtual cockpit visualize it all. Its 12.3-inch color display is the groundbreaking alternative to the conventional dial instruments and presents all information as tack-sharp graphics. If desired, a head-up display projects data from the assistance and navigation systems onto the windshield in the driver&rsquo;s direct field of vision. For audio enthusiasts, Audi offers the optional Bose sound system and Bang &amp; Olufsen Advanced Sound System with 3D sound. Loudspeakers in the A-pillars depict the spatial dimension of height.</p>','2016-11-22 06:40:05','news'),(4,'Our model and technology initiative ','<p><img src=\"/img/article/Our model and technology initiative /general.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\r\n<div class=\"page-row has-no-item-box\">\r\n<div id=\"item-9bb7973b-ccdb-4f4c-bc5d-375f88c75c35\" class=\"page-item--intro\">\r\n<div class=\"intro-text\">\r\n<p><strong>In 2016, the Audi Group aims once again to increase the number of cars delivered, maintain its high level of profitability and continue investing large amounts in the future. At the 127th Annual General Meeting this Thursday in Ingolstadt, the Board of Management of AUDI AG explained to the shareholders the financial statements for the year 2015, current developments and the goals for this year. In addition, Rupert Stadler, Chairman of the Board of Management of AUDI AG, provided an outlook on the coming decade for the premium brand.</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"page-row has-no-item-box\">\r\n<div id=\"item-ff5ed68c-4945-4765-84d7-bd5b35825039\" class=\"page-item--text\">\r\n<div class=\"style-links-for-body-text\">\r\n<p>&ldquo;We performed well in financial year 2015 despite all the challenges,&rdquo; stated Stadler. This can be seen for example from the record number of 1.8&nbsp;million Audi?brand cars delivered and the operating profit at the high level of the previous&nbsp;year. Adjusted operating profit amounted to &euro;5.1&nbsp;billion; including special items, also relating to the diesel issue, it amounted to &euro;4.8&nbsp;billion.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We aim for further growth in 2016,&rdquo; stated Stadler. After the first four months of the year, Audi is well on the way to achieving this goal. In 2016, for the first time more than 600,000&nbsp;customers decided in favor of an Audi in the period of January through April. The company delivered 620,100&nbsp;automobiles with the Four&nbsp;Rings in the first four&nbsp;months of this year &ndash; 4.9&nbsp;percent more than in the prior?year period.</p>\r\n<p>The Audi&nbsp;Group will publish its key financial metrics for the first quarter of the year on June&nbsp;1. With a view to the full year, Axel&nbsp;Strotbek, Member of the Board&nbsp;of&nbsp;Management for Finance&nbsp;and&nbsp;Organization, stated: &ldquo;We are currently in a phase of enormous advance expenditure for the mobility of tomorrow.&rdquo; Nonetheless, Audi once again aims to achieve an operating&nbsp;return&nbsp;on&nbsp;sales within its strategic target corridor of eight&nbsp;to&nbsp;ten&nbsp;percent and a net&nbsp;cash&nbsp;flow of between &euro;2&nbsp;billion and &euro;2.5&nbsp;billion.</p>\r\n<p>For the year 2016, the company plans total investment in property, plant and equipment of more than &euro;3&nbsp;billion, once again to be fully financed from its own resources. &ldquo;We will gain the required scope for that by optimizing our processes and costs and by consistently prioritizing the important topics for the future with our investment projects,&rdquo; stated Strotbek.</p>\r\n<p>The key points are a course of systematic innovation and the expansion of the product range. &ldquo;Our model and technology initiative will ensure our growth of tomorrow,&rdquo; stated Stadler, &ldquo;Electrification and digitization represent an historic shift. We will play a large part in shaping this change and will thus further enhance our strong position.&rdquo; A large proportion of the planned investment will flow into these projects. In addition, Audi will strengthen its team this year, in Germany alone with 1,200&nbsp;experts in strategic areas for the future.</p>\r\n<p>This year, more than 20&nbsp;new or upgraded Audi&nbsp;models will be launched, including the Audi&nbsp;Q2*. With this compact City?SUV, the Ingolstadt?based company plans to gain new, urban customers for the brand. It will have its own SIM&nbsp;card including an unlimited data plan, and will therefore have an Internet connection as standard equipment. Optionally, mobile devices will be able to go online via a Wi?Fi&nbsp;hotspot. Furthermore, the SUV offers a wide range of connect&nbsp;services as well as numerous driver?assistance systems from higher?range models.</p>\r\n<p>At the top end of the range, Audi is expanding its successful Q&nbsp;family with the sporty&nbsp;SQ7&nbsp;TDI* and the Q7&nbsp;<span class=\"nowrap\">e-tron</span>&nbsp;quattro*, the brand&rsquo;s second plug?in&nbsp;hybrid. Its standard fuel consumption is less than two liter per&nbsp;100&nbsp;kilometers (better than 117&nbsp;miles per US gallon). The Q7&nbsp;<span class=\"nowrap\">e-tron</span> can travel up to 56&nbsp;kilometers in purely electric mode, meaning that most day?to?day journeys can be made without causing any local emissions at all.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','2016-11-22 06:40:06','news'),(5,'Audi opens new, highly efficient paint shop','<div id=\"item-72879214-4593-48ab-a726-32d689b8d271\" class=\"page-item--text\">\r\n<div class=\"style-links-for-body-text\">\r\n<p><img src=\"/img/article/Audi opens new, highly efficient paint shop/general.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\r\n<div class=\"page-row has-no-item-box\">\r\n<div id=\"item-f71f8b11-54e7-4fb9-ab5b-c759d7e9db93\" class=\"page-item--intro\">\r\n<div class=\"intro-text\">\r\n<p><strong>Audi has put a new topcoat paint shop into operation at its plant in Ingolstadt.

Installation of equipment started in March&nbsp;2015 and the topping?out ceremony was in July. Series operation began in spring&nbsp;2016 after a construction period of just two&nbsp;years. At present, 650&nbsp;car bodies are painted there each day; the maximum daily capacity of approximately 900&nbsp;cars per day is to be achieved by the end of the year. The models Audi&nbsp;A4 and A5 are currently painted in the new paint shop, later to be followed by the Audi&nbsp;A3 and Q2.</p>\r\n<p>The new paint shop is one of the most environmentally friendly in the world, resulting from state?of?the?art technologies such as air recirculation, dry separation and exhaust air cleaning. These measures allow a significant reduction in the use of resources, so that heating energy and water consumption per car are reduced by 20&nbsp;percent. Air recirculation also helps to reduce CO??emissions per painted car by 30&nbsp;percent, while the cleaning of exhaust air reduces emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by 90&nbsp;percent. Prof.&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Hubert&nbsp;Waltl, Member of the Board of Management of AUDI&nbsp;AG for Production and Logistics, stated: &ldquo;Sustainable operations have high priority at Audi. That&rsquo;s why we are continually further developing our production technologies. This is the only way for us to live up to our high demands in terms of quality, environmental compatibility and energy efficiency. With the construction of the new paint shop, we placed great importance on high standards of resource efficiency and ecology.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The member of the Works&nbsp;Council campaigned for this new paint shop. It is an investment in the future and thus a further commitment by the company to the main Audi plant in Ingolstadt,&rdquo; said Peter&nbsp;Mosch. The Chairman of the Group Works Council of AUDI&nbsp;AG believes the ergonomic design of workplaces in the new paint shop shows that technological progress and humane working conditions are not contradictory aims.</p>\r\n<p>The new topcoat point line?in the north of the plant site also introduces state?of?the?art painting technology at Audi: Paint?application equipment with robot technology and electrostatic high?speed rotation spray guns carry out the painting process fully automatically. With the so?called bell?bell method, paint is applied only electrostatically, thus achieving higher efficiency. In combination with dry separation, this also benefits the environment.

The 25-year-old Belgian has won three international GT Championships and four 24-hour races in the Audi R8 LMS. He is familiar with the 6.12-kilometer circuit from his Formula 3 days as well and competed in the GT race there two years ago too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Audi DTM driver Nico M&uuml;ller, on the other hand, will be breaking new ground and is practicing the track in the simulator. &ldquo;In Macau, the world&rsquo;s best GT campaigners are pitted against each other. There are many Macau specialists and I&rsquo;ll be racing there for the first time, which is a pretty stiff challenge,&rdquo; says the Swiss. However, having won a DTM race at the Norisring this year, he has proven how fast he is on city street circuits. The 24-year-old pro is going to compete for the German Phoenix Racing team. His teammate, contesting the event under Audi Hong Kong&rsquo;s entry, is Marchy Lee. He became the champion of the first Audi R8 LMS Cup season in 2012 and is intimately familiar with the circuit through the street canyons from several races he has contested in the Audi R8 LMS.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','2016-11-22 06:40:08','sport'),(7,'FIA WEC to race in Audi’s largest market','<p><img src=\"/img/article/FIA WEC to race in Audi&rsquo;s largest market/general.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\r\n<div class=\"page-row has-no-item-box\">\r\n<div id=\"item-04cf131d-9b2d-4d86-b0b6-61d481709447\" class=\"page-item--intro\">\r\n<div class=\"intro-text\">\r\n<p><strong>For Audi, an important race is coming up before its imminent withdrawal from the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC). Once a year, the LMP sports cars visit China &ndash; the company&rsquo;s largest market. On Sunday, November 6, Audi is going to battle for points and trophies in the 6 Hours of Shanghai.</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"page-row has-no-item-box\">\r\n<div id=\"item-a1d0d929-48e5-4906-81b5-47336c502222\" class=\"page-item--text\">\r\n<div class=\"style-links-for-body-text\">\r\n<p>The race is getting closer and closer. Most recently, in Japan, Audi missed victory by just 1.439 seconds. The near-five-year history of the FIA WEC has seen an even closer outcome only once before and this season, it has been the narrowest margin by which a race has been decided to date. &ldquo;If you aim to win in this hard-fought series, you can&rsquo;t afford the slightest weakness,&rdquo; says Head of Audi Motorsport Dr. Wolfgang Ullrich. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re leaving no stone unturned to make another step ahead in China.&rdquo; In the second half of 2016, the current Audi R18 has been more competitive on these circuits than its predecessors. All three manufacturers of hybrid sports cars &ndash; Audi, Porsche and Toyota &ndash; have demonstrated that they are in contention for victory. Following the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Audi has consistently improved in the subsequent four WEC rounds. At the N&uuml;rburgring, the brand with the four rings led the race for 46 laps, which equates to about 24 percent of the distance. In Mexico, Audi increased this rate to 27 percent, and to 61 percent at Austin. Most recently, at Fuji, the R18 was the front runner for almost 72 percent of all race laps. In total, Audi led these four rounds over a distance of 1.935 kilometers. Five pole positions in 2016 and three fastest laps in the most recent four events underline the qualities of the technology and the drivers.</p>\r\n<p>On clinching second place in Japan, Lucas di Grassi/Lo&iuml;c Duval/Oliver Jarvis (BR/F/GB) reduced the deficit to the leaders of the standings by 9 to 28.5 points for Audi Sport Team Joest. At the same time, another driver trio &ndash; Mike Conway/Kamui Kobayashi/St&eacute;phane Sarrazin &ndash; inserted itself between the Audi campaigners and the front runners. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to see a three-way battle for the title,&rdquo; says Stefan Dreyer, Head of LMP at Audi Sport. &ldquo;However, as far as the gaps are concerned, we have to remain realistic. Mathematically, everything is still possible, but with 52 points yet to be awarded, the leaders of the standings do have a clear advantage. We will spare no effort to keep the battle open until the end.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','2016-11-22 06:40:10','sport'),(8,'Audi Sport TT Cup in Franconian Monaco','<p><img src=\"/img/article/Audi Sport TT Cup in Franconian Monaco/general.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\r\n<div class=\"page-row has-no-item-box\">\r\n<div id=\"item-a2189ed0-b755-4661-b8c3-e438c00c003d\" class=\"page-item--intro\">\r\n<div class=\"intro-text\">\r\n<p><strong>Following its visit to the 24-hour race at the N&uuml;rburgring, the Audi Sport TT Cup is back on familiar ground.

It is the home round for the brand with the four rings and promises to deliver gripping motorsport again. &ldquo;Last year, the spectators saw two thrilling races with many fantastic duels,&rdquo; says Project Leader Philipp Mondelaers. &ldquo;Only the rain on Saturday put a slight damper on the mood. Hopefully, the whole weekend will be dry this year.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>With three victories in four races the South African Sheldon van der Linde is the dominant campaigner at the moment. Two drivers are lurking behind the 17-year-old overall leader: Dennis Marschall, who finished last season in third place, and Joonas Lappalainen from Finland. Having clinched podium places at Hocken&shy;heim and at the N&uuml;rburgring, both drivers have demonstrated their ambitions for the title. Now, they are set on taking advantage of their experience from the Audi Sport TT Cup&rsquo;s inaugural season on the 2.3-kilometer high-speed track. &ldquo;The Norisring is a great circuit requiring a lot of discipline. As there are practically no run-off areas the track commands high concentration of the field,&rdquo; says Chris Reinke, Head of Audi Sport customer racing.</p>\r\n<p>In the guest entrants&rsquo; classification, Bundesliga coach Michael Henke will be battling for victory. The 59-year-old&rsquo;s career includes stints as assistant coach of Borussia Dortmund and FC Bayern M&uuml;nchen. Since 2013, Henke has been active in this role at FC Ingolstadt.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','2016-11-22 06:40:11','sport');
