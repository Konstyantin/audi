It is configured as a purely mechanical planetary gear with zero lag. During normal driving operation, the self-locking center differential distributes the power asymmetrically, with 60&nbsp;percent flowing to the rear axle and 40 percent to the front axle.</p>\r\n<p>Oblique splines produce axial forces immediately when torque is transferred by the differential. These forces act on friction discs to produce a locking torque that diverts the torque to the wheels with the better traction.</p>\r\n<p>In its latest form, the center differential can divert 70&nbsp;percent of the torque to the front, or up to 85&nbsp;percent to the rear. The high locking values enable a clearly defined distribution of torque and highly precise interaction with the control systems, such as the ESC and wheel-selective torque control.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Even more dynamic: the sport differential<br /></strong>For even greater dynamics and driving safety, top-of-the-line Audi&nbsp;models based on the modular longitudinal platform can also be equipped with the sport differential. The sport differential really allows the handling to shine. It actively distributes the drive torque between the rear wheels, literally pushing the car into the curve and eliminating any tendency toward understeer. The vehicle is stabilized in the case of oversteer. The result is agile and predictable road behavior at all times.</p>\r\n<p>The sport differential is a conventional differential with two superposition units mounted on the left and right, each containing a multi-plate clutch and an internal gear. The drive torque can be variably distributed between the wheels of the rear axle with the help of the superposition units. The hydraulic controller actuates the multi-plate clutches. An electric motor drives the high-performance oil pump, which generates the required hydraulic pressure. All functions are controlled and monitored by a separate control unit. The active distribution of torque provides for better driving dynamics, traction and stability.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Modular transverse platform: Electrohydraulic multi-plate clutch</strong><strong><br /> </strong>For the compact models with transverse-mounted engine, Audi uses a quattro&nbsp;drivetrain featuring an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch with hydraulic actuator. It is mounted on the rear axle for better weight distribution.</p>\r\n<p>Inside the clutch is a package of metal friction rings mounted in pairs one behind the other. One ring of each pair is permanently meshed with the clutch basket, which rotates with the propshaft. The other ring of each pair is connected to the shaft leading to the rear differential. The electronically controlled multi-plate clutch guarantees the best possible traction, driving dynamics and driving safety while providing for dynamic handling with actively controlled torque distribution.</p>\r\n<p>In the Audi&nbsp;TT, Audi&nbsp;S1, RS&nbsp;Q3* and Audi&nbsp;RS&nbsp;3&nbsp;Sportback*, there is a strong dynamic bias to the management of the multi-plate clutch. On a road surface with a low coefficient of friction, controlled drifts are possible when in sport mode or with the ESC deactivated. In contrast, when driven sedately, the clutch of the TT can be automatically opened temporarily to save fuel. The quattro&nbsp;drive is immediately reactivated when the driving situation changes. In all three model series, the quattro all-wheel drive system works closely together with wheel-selective torque control, a software function of the ESC stabilization control that uses light, defined braking to precisely distribute the drive torque to further improve handling at the limit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Audi R8: actively controlled front differential</strong><strong><br /> </strong>In the Audi R8, the seven-speed S&nbsp;tronic with integrated rear-axle differential and locking center differential is mounted in the back behind the engine and sends the power to the front axle via a propshaft. The electrohydraulic multi-plate clutch integrated in the front differential transmits the calculated torque to the front wheels within just a few milliseconds. The combination of the high-performance transmission mechanism and the all-wheel drive software tailored to a mid-engine sports car allows for driving dynamics featuring an unprecedented balance between agility and driving safety.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The future: e</strong>?<strong>tron quattro</strong><strong><br /> </strong>Audi presented a future form of the quattro&nbsp;drive &ndash; the electrified quattro, aka the <span class=\"nowrap\">e-tron</span>&nbsp;quattro &ndash; in the Audi&nbsp;<span class=\"nowrap\">e-tron</span> quattro&nbsp;concept, a concept study that was the star of the IAA&nbsp;2015. The sport SUV uses three powerful electric motors, one on the front axle and two on the rear axle. At low load, one motor is solely responsible for propulsion. When the driver floors the accelerator and all three electric motors are working together, however, 370&nbsp;kW of output and more than 800&nbsp;Nm <em>(590.0&nbsp;lb?ft)</em> of torque are available.</p>\r\n<p>The drivetrain management system orients on the position of the accelerator, the mode chosen in Audi drive select, the driving program &ndash; S or D &ndash; and the battery charge level. The focus is on not just powerful performance, but also maximum efficiency. At the start of a trip, the Audi&nbsp;<span class=\"nowrap\">e-tron</span>&nbsp;quattro concept can compute a strategy for using the smallest possible amount of electricity. Underway it can recover energy by means of braking recuperation.</p>\r\n<p>Power is distributed to the front and rear axle as a function of a multitude of parameters. During sporty driving, the concept with the two electric motors on the rear axle enables electric torque vectoring similar to the function of the sport differential. The Torque Control Manager actively distributes the power between the rear wheels as necessary. This torque control provides for maximum dynamics and stability. Thanks to the nearly instantaneous response of the electric motors, all control actions are lightning-quick.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>The equipment and data specified in this document refer to the model range offered in Germany. Subject to change without notice; errors and omissions excepted.<img src=\"/img/technology/Quattro/AT110043_large.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></strong></p>\r\n<p>The Audi <span class=\"nowrap\">e-tron</span> quattro combines sportiness and efficiency in a new and fascinating way. The technology demonstrator was designed at Audi&rsquo;s ePerformance project house as a parallel hybrid with plug-in technology. An additional electric motor drives the rear axle; its power is divided between both wheels. The concept demonstrates the potential of an innovative, partly electric quattro drive system.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The drive components <br /></strong>The <span class=\"nowrap\">e-tron</span> quattro employs a parallel hybrid drive with an added second electric motor. Its engine compartment holds an especially efficient gasoline unit &ndash; the 2.0&nbsp;TFSI yields 155 kW (211 hp) and 350 Nm of (258.15 lb-ft) torque, the latter from 1,500 to 4,200 rpm. Directly behind is the front electric motor &ndash; the permanently excited synchronous machine (PSM) generates 33 kW (45 hp) of power and 211 Nm (155.63 lb-ft) of torque.</p>\r\n<p>An intelligently and gently operating dry clutch connects the electric motor with both the TFSI and the automatic four-speed transmission. By way of this component the combustion engine and the front electric motor drive the front wheels of the technology demonstrator.</p>\r\n<p>A lithium-ion battery serves as the electrical energy storage device, and has been placed in the center tunnel for an ideal center of gravity. It stores up to 9.4 kWh of energy, of which 6.5 kWh is available for use. The Audi <span class=\"nowrap\">e-tron</span> quattro embodies the plug-in concept &ndash; the battery can also be recharged at the socket. The process takes about two hours with a 230V household current. The power electronics converting the direct current from the battery to alternating current for the electric motors are located in the engine compartment for the front electric motor and in the spare wheel well for the rear electric motor.</p>\r\n<p>The drive management system always uses the optimal drive source for the respective operating mode. In normal operation, the <span class=\"nowrap\">e-tron</span> quattro is trimmed for maximum efficiency. When driving overland or on the freeway, the hybrid drive at the front wheels is used. The electric motor at the rear axle cuts in as a supporting measure when the driver accelerates. The direct connection via a friction-optimized, single-stage planetary gear affords high efficiency. If an axle loses its grip on a slippery road, or if optimal transverse dynamic performance so requires, the drive torque is transmitted to the corresponding axle within fractions of a second as needed.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>'),(2,'Lighting','<p><strong>Audi is now building on its lead in the domain of lighting technology with a world first: The Audi Matrix LED headlights will make their debut on the new A8, which is appearing on the market at the end of 2013. Audi, the technology leader in this field, is thus opening a new chapter in automotive lighting technology.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"/img/technology/Lighting/A156497_large.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></strong></p>\r\n<p>Audi Matrix LED technology splits up the LED high-beam headlights into numerous individual, small diodes working in conjunction with lenses or reflectors connected in series. Managed by a responsive control unit, they are activated and deactivated or dimmed individually according to the situation. This means they always supply high-precision illumination and achieve the maximum possible light yield without needing a pivoting mechanism.</p>\r\n<p>In the new Audi A8, each headlight comprises 25 high-beam light-emitting diodes, arranged in groups of five per reflector. When the light switch is set to &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; and the high-beam headlights are on, the system is activated from 30 km/h (18.64&nbsp;mph) on highways and from 60 km/h (37.28 mph) on city streets. The Audi Matrix LED headlights produce a quality of light with a special crystalline sheen. By day, too, they have a very attractive and distinctive look, which is reinforced by the new appearance of the daytime running lights.</p>\r\n<p>As soon the camera in the A8 detects oncoming vehicles, the Audi Matrix LED headlights dip the relevant sections of the high-beam headlights. The system operates with such precision that it blanks out light that would shine directly onto oncoming and preceding vehicles, but continues to cast the high beams with full power on all other zones between and beside them.&nbsp;When there is no more oncoming traffic, the high-beam headlights then resume full power, including the sections that had previously been off. The light that the driver sees is always bright, homogeneous and much more effective than that produced by competitors&rsquo; mechanical dipping systems.</p>\r\n<p>Matrix LED technology offers fascinating potential in many different respects, in terms of the number of individual LEDs, their arrangement, and the size and design of the headlights. One of its safety functions in the Audi A8 involves providing what are known as marker lights: These team up with the optional night vision assistant to mark detected pedestrians. When it detects a person in the critical range in front of the car, individual LEDs flash at them rapidly three times in succession, picking out the pedestrian clearly from their surroundings and alerting both the pedestrian and the driver.</p>\r\n<p>The light-emitting diodes of the Audi Matrix LED headlights also perform the cornering light function; they displace the emphasis of the beam in the direction of the bend. By calling on predictive route data supplied by the MMI navigation plus, they do so shortly before the steering needs to be turned. Another function in the new Audi A8 is the turn signal with dynamic display: The LEDs in the turn signals flash in blocks at 150 millisecond intervals in the direction that the driver intends to turn.</p>\r\n<p>In the new Audi A8, the turn signal lights will now indicate the turning direction in an innovative way, which has the potential to significantly enhance traffic safety. That is because the lights provide a visual signal that can be clearly and quickly perceived, even at long distances and in poor visibility.</p>\r\n<p>Each of the enhanced headlights contains18 light-emitting diodes arranged in a strip that is subdivided into seven blocks. Each tail light contains 24 LEDs in eight segments, which are used to dynamically indicate the turning direction. During flashing, the blocks are sequentially activated at 20 millisecond intervals, from the inside outwards in the desired turning direction. After 150 milliseconds, all segments are bright; for another 250 milliseconds they illuminate with full intensity. Afterwards, the turn signals go dark before repeating the lighting sequence.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/img/technology/Lighting/AT130155_medium.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\r\n<p>As the leading brand in automotive lighting technology, Audi has systematically developed all aspects of OLED technology over the years. Matrix&nbsp;OLED&nbsp;lights combine high?tech engineering and design ideally &ndash; initial projects are currently underway to implement OLED&nbsp;technology in production tail lights. They are being shown for the first time in a concept car at the IAA.</p>\r\n<p>OLED is an English acronym for &ldquo;organic light emitting diode.&rdquo; In each OLED unit, two&nbsp;electrodes &ndash; of which at least one must be transparent &ndash; incorporate numerous thin layers of organic semiconductor materials. A low DC&nbsp;voltage &ndash; between three and four&nbsp;volts &ndash; activates the layers, each of which is less than one?thousandth of a millimeter thick, to light them. The color is based on the molecular composition of the light source.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast to point light sources &ndash; such as LEDs &ndash; which are made of semiconductor crystals, OLEDs are flat light sources. Their light attains a new level of homogeneity, and its dimming is continuously variable. The lights do not cast any shadows and do not require any reflectors, light guides or similar optical components &ndash; and this makes the OLED&nbsp;units efficient and lightweight. In addition, they hardly need any cooling.</p>\r\n<p>Progress in OLED&nbsp;technology is being made rapidly &ndash; in part due to the driving force of Audi. As soon as further increases in light density are realized, OLEDs will soon be able to generate turn signal and brake lights too. The thin glass sheets that are used today to encase the organic material will be replaced by plastic films. These new flexible substrate materials will lend themselves to three?dimensional forming, and this will open up entirely new creative spaces for designers.</p>\r\n<p>Audi has already shown the potential of OLED&nbsp;technology in many models and demonstrators. Special highlights are &ldquo;OLED&nbsp;lighting&rdquo; with transparent, multi-colored OLEDs in the silhouette of the car and &ldquo;the swarm&rdquo; with a three-dimensional OLED display.</p>'),(3,'Assistent','<p><strong>The premium brand is developing a new high-resolution map materials together with competent partners.
